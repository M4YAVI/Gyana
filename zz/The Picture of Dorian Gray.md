### The beginning: a beautiful young man

The story begins in London, in the art studio of **Basil Hallward**, a painter. Basil is finishing a portrait of a young man named **Dorian Gray**. Basil believes this painting is the best work he has ever done. It captures not only Dorian’s looks, but something deeper—his innocence and purity.

Basil is deeply impressed by Dorian. He does not hide that Dorian inspires him more than anyone else ever has.

While Basil is painting, his friend **Lord Henry Wotton** is present. Lord Henry is charming, clever, and dangerous in a quiet way. He enjoys playing with ideas and influencing people. He believes that:

- youth is the most important thing in life
- beauty should be worshipped
- pleasure should always come before morality

When Dorian meets Lord Henry, something shifts.

## The fatal idea

Lord Henry speaks to Dorian about youth and beauty, saying that they fade quickly and should be enjoyed without restraint. Until this moment, Dorian has never thought deeply about aging.

Suddenly, Dorian becomes aware of how young and beautiful he is—and how temporary it all is.

When he sees the finished portrait, he is overwhelmed. The painting will stay young forever, but he will grow old.

In a moment of strong emotion, Dorian makes a wish:

- he wishes that **the portrait would age instead of him**
- and that he himself would remain young forever

No one takes this wish seriously. It sounds like emotional exaggeration.

But the wish will come true.

## Love and cruelty

Soon after, Dorian falls in love with a young actress named **Sibyl Vane**. She performs in cheap theaters but acts beautifully. Dorian loves her not for who she truly is, but for how well she plays romantic roles.

He brings Basil and Lord Henry to watch her perform.

That night, something goes wrong.

Sibyl acts terribly. Her performance is flat and lifeless.

Why?  
Because she has fallen genuinely in love with Dorian and no longer wants to pretend on stage. Acting now feels false to her.

Dorian is furious and humiliated. He tells Sibyl she has destroyed his love. He leaves her cruelly.

---

## The first change in the portrait

When Dorian returns home, he notices something unsettling.

The portrait looks slightly different.

The face has changed—just a little. There is a hint of cruelty around the mouth.

Dorian realizes the truth:

- the portrait reflects his moral corruption
- his wish has come true

Terrified and ashamed, he decides to apologize to Sibyl.

But before he can do so, he receives terrible news.

Sibyl has **killed herself**.

## Dorian’s choice

At first, Dorian feels guilt. But Lord Henry quickly reframes the tragedy, calling it romantic and poetic rather than cruel.

Dorian accepts this idea.

He decides:

- the portrait will bear the burden of his sins
- he will live freely, without worrying about consequences

He locks the painting away in a hidden room.

From this moment on, Dorian begins a life of pleasure and moral decay.

---

## Years of corruption

Time passes. Dorian remains young and beautiful, unchanged by age.

But rumors spread about him:

- people whisper that he ruins lives
- friends distance themselves from him
- reputations are destroyed after knowing him

No one can prove anything, because Dorian looks innocent.

Meanwhile, the portrait grows more horrifying:

- the face becomes twisted
- the eyes look cruel
- the expression reflects every sin Dorian commits

Dorian becomes both fascinated and disgusted by it.

## Basil confronts Dorian

One night, many years later, **Basil Hallward** confronts Dorian. Basil has heard the rumors and begs Dorian to deny them.

Dorian, tired of hiding, takes Basil to the locked room and shows him the portrait.

Basil is horrified. He recognizes his work, but it has become monstrous.

He urges Dorian to repent.

Dorian, filled with rage and fear, murders Basil.

Afterward, the portrait shows blood on its hands.

---

## Blackmail and deeper darkness

Dorian forces a former friend, **Alan Campbell**, to help him destroy Basil’s body. He blackmails Alan, who is clearly terrified.

Later, Alan takes his own life.

Dorian continues living as before, pretending nothing has happened.

---

## An attempt at goodness

Eventually, Dorian grows weary and frightened. He wonders if it is possible to escape his fate.

He decides to do a good deed.

He meets a young woman in the countryside and chooses not to corrupt her. He believes this act might redeem him.

He rushes home to check the portrait.

Instead of improving, the portrait looks worse.

Dorian realizes the truth:

- even this “good” act was motivated by vanity
- he wanted to feel proud, not truly repentant

There is no escape without genuine change.

---

## The end

Desperate and furious, Dorian decides to destroy the portrait.

He takes the knife—the same one he used to kill Basil—and stabs the painting.

A loud crash is heard.

When servants enter the room, they find:

- the portrait restored to its original beauty
- an old, ugly, withered man lying dead on the floor

They recognize him only by his rings.

Dorian Gray is dead.

His body now reflects everything the portrait once showed.

## What the story is really about

Oscar Wilde is exploring:

- the danger of worshipping beauty
- the cost of living without conscience
- how avoiding consequences does not remove guilt
- how influence, when unchecked, can destroy a person

Dorian does not fall because he is evil at the start.  
He falls because he chooses pleasure over responsibility—again and again.
