The story opens in a house that's basically the ultimate smart home, way ahead of its time. This is the Hadley family's "Happylife Home," and it does everything for them—ties their shoes, cooks their meals, rocks them to sleep. The parents, George and Lydia Hadley, have two kids: Peter and Wendy, around ten years old.

The centerpiece of this house is something called the nursery, but it's not your typical playroom. It's a massive virtual reality room with walls that can become any place the children imagine. The technology reads their thoughts and projects entire environments around them—sights, sounds, smells, heat, everything. It feels completely real.

Lydia comes to George one day feeling anxious. She's worried about the nursery. Lately, it's been stuck on one scene: an African veldt, which is a type of grassland. Hot sun beating down, vultures circling in the sky, lions feeding on something in the distance. She hears screaming sometimes. It's been the same scene for weeks, and it's starting to frighten her.

George goes to look, and sure enough, there's this intense African landscape. It's so realistic he can feel the heat, smell the dried grass. He sees the lions far off, tearing into something. He notices the vultures watching. There's something unsettling about it, but he tries to brush it off. Still, Lydia insists something is wrong with the room—or wrong with the children.

They start noticing other odd things. When they check the nursery, they find one of George's old wallets on the ground, chewed up and bloody. Then one of Lydia's scarves, also torn and stained. These are their belongings, showing up in this imaginary world. It's like the children have been thinking about them—about their parents—while creating this scene.

George begins to realize how much the nursery, and really the whole house, has replaced them as parents. The house does everything, so the kids don't need them anymore. The children have formed a stronger bond with the nursery than with their actual mother and father. Peter and Wendy spend all their time in there, and when George suggests they turn off the nursery for a while, or even take a vacation away from the house, the children react with pure rage.

George decides they need to take action. He calls a psychologist friend named David McClean to come look at the nursery. McClean takes one look at that African veldt and tells George plainly: this is not good. The children's minds are stuck on death and violence. The room has become a channel for their darker feelings. He recommends they shut down the entire house immediately and get the family back to a normal life where they actually do things for themselves.

George agrees. He tells Peter and Wendy that they're shutting down the house—the nursery especially—and they're going to start living like a regular family. The children beg and plead. They promise they'll behave, they'll change. Just give them one last minute in the nursery to say goodbye. Just one minute.

George, feeling a bit guilty about how upset they are, agrees. One last minute.

Peter and Wendy go into the nursery. A moment later, they call for their parents. "Come here, we want to show you something." George and Lydia walk into the nursery, into that hot African veldt. And then the door slams shut behind them.

George runs to the door. It's locked. From the outside. The lions in the distance lift their heads. They've noticed the parents now. They start walking toward them, and then running. George screams for the children to unlock the door. He pounds on it. Lydia is screaming too.

The story cuts away.

David McClean arrives at the house a little while later, as planned, to help them move out. He finds Peter and Wendy sitting peacefully in the living room, having a picnic. He asks where their parents are. The children say calmly that they'll be here soon. McClean hears a scream from somewhere. He walks toward the nursery and looks inside.

There's the African veldt. The lions are in the distance, feeding on something fresh. The vultures are circling, landing, joining in. And that's where the story ends—with the clear but unspoken understanding that the children have fed their parents to the lions. The technology they loved more than their own family became the weapon they used to destroy them.

It's a chilling story about what happens when we let technology raise our children, and when convenience replaces genuine human connection. Bradbury wrote it in 1950, and it feels more relevant every year.
