For centuries, physics was predictable. Newton's laws basically said: if you know where something is and how fast it's moving, you can predict its future perfectly. Everything was like billiard balls - particles had definite positions, definite speeds, and followed clear paths.

Then around 1900, scientists started studying really tiny stuff and everything went to hell. Three major discoveries shattered the classical worldview:

**Black Body Radiation Problem**: When you heat up objects, they glow. Classical physics said hot objects should emit infinite energy at high frequencies. Obviously that's nonsense - your toaster doesn't destroy the universe. Max Planck figured out energy comes in discrete chunks called "quanta." Energy isn't continuous like a flowing river - it's more like individual water droplets. This was the birth of quantum theory.

**Photoelectric Effect**: Einstein discovered light behaves weirdly. Shine light on metal, electrons get kicked out. But here's the kicker - it doesn't matter how bright the light is, only the color (frequency) matters. Dim blue light knocks out electrons, but bright red light does nothing. Light acts like particles (photons) carrying specific energy packets, not just waves.

**The Atom Problem**: Rutherford discovered atoms have a tiny nucleus with electrons orbiting around it. But classical physics said these orbiting electrons should spiral into the nucleus instantly, radiating energy. Atoms should collapse in microseconds. Since you exist, that's clearly wrong.

**Enter Quantum Mechanics**

The solution? Particles at tiny scales don't follow classical rules. They exist in probability clouds, not definite locations. An electron doesn't orbit the nucleus like a planet - it exists in probability distributions called orbitals. You can calculate the odds of finding it somewhere, but you can't say exactly where it is until you measure it.

**Wave-Particle Duality**

This is where your brain starts hurting. Light and matter exhibit both wave and particle properties depending on how you observe them. Shoot photons one at a time through two slits, and they create an interference pattern like waves. But detect which slit each photon goes through, and the wave pattern disappears. The act of measuring changes the behavior.

**Uncertainty Principle**

Heisenberg figured out you literally cannot know both the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously with perfect accuracy. It's not about bad instruments - it's a fundamental limit of reality. The more precisely you know where something is, the less you can know about where it's going.

**Superposition**

Since particles exist as probability waves until measured, they can be in multiple states simultaneously. That electron? It's not just in one orbital - it's in a combination of all possible orbitals until you force it to "choose" by measuring.

**The Quantum Measurement Problem**

Here's the brutal part that still messes with physicists' heads: what counts as "measurement"? When does the probability wave collapse into definite reality? Is it when a detector clicks? When a human looks? Nobody really knows, and honestly, it might be the wrong question entirely.

This is the foundation quantum computing exploits. We're basically using the fact that reality is fundamentally probabilistic and weird at small scales to process information in ways classical systems can't touch.

The key insight: classical physics is just quantum physics averaged out over big things. Your coffee mug follows predictable laws because it contains trillions of quantum particles whose weirdness cancels out statistically. But isolate a few particles, and the universe gets freaky.
