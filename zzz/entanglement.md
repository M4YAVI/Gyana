 When qubits get entangled, measuring one instantly affects the other, regardless of distance. Einstein called it "spooky action at a distance" because he thought it was garbage, but turns out he was wrong. We use this to create correlations between qubits that classical systems literally cannot replicate.


The brutal truth though? Most of what you hear about quantum computing is overhyped. We're nowhere near replacing classical computers. Current quantum machines are sketchy - they need to be cooled to near absolute zero, they're riddled with errors, and they can only maintain quantum states for microseconds. It's called decoherence, and it's a nightmare.
