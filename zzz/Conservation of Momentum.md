**The Point:** Motion cannot be created or destroyed, only swapped; whatever "oomph" one object loses in a crash, the other object must gain.

**Analogy:** It is like a bank transfer: if you send $20 to a friend, you lose $20 and they gain $20, but the total money between the two of you stays exactly the same.

It is called conserve cuz Momentum shifts, not disappears. It's conserved because the total stays constant.
