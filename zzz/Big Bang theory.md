If I had to put a number on it, I'd say the scientific confidence in the Big Bang is about **99.9%**.  
Why so high? Because the evidence is overwhelming.

1. **Expansion:** We can see galaxies moving away from us.
2. **The Afterglow:** We can literally detect the heat left over from the explosion (the Cosmic Microwave Background).
3. **Chemicals:** The theory predicts exactly how much hydrogen and helium should be in the universe, and our measurements match those predictions almost perfectly.
