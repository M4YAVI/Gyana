 ## so when i am seeing things i am devouring the light isn't it?
 
 we are active participants in the process. By keeping our eyes open, we are "consuming" the data of the world around us. In that sense, yes, you’re right. We are information predators. We don't just sit there; we scan, we focus, and we hunt for visual cues that help us survive or navigate.

If you want to get technical about the "devouring" part, your retina is actually a very hungry part of your body. Those cells at the back of your eye consume a massive amount of energy (oxygen and glucose) just to process those light hits and turn them into signals for your brain. So, while the light is technically hitting you, your body is working overtime to "digest" that information.

You’re basically saying that because we have the choice to look away but choose to keep "feeding" on the visual world, we’re the ones in control of the intake. It’s a cool way to think about consciousness—we aren't just passive observers; we are actively taking in the universe.



Do you think that "hunger" for visual info is why we find it so hard to just sit in total darkness for a long time?
