**1. Voltage (Volts)** is the **pushing force**.

- **Analogy:** The **Water Pressure** (or the height of the water tank) pushing water through the pipe.

**2. Current (Amps)** is the **actual flow**.

- **Analogy:** The **amount of water** actually moving through the pipe right now.

**3. Resistance (Ohms)** is the **obstacle**.

- **Analogy:** A **narrow section** or kink in the hose that restricts how much water can get through.

**4. Capacitor** is a **temporary storage tank**.

- **Analogy:** A **bucket** attached to the pipe that fills up to store water, then dumps it out quickly when needed (like a camera flash).

**5. Inductor** is a **stabilizer** (resists change).

- **Analogy:** A heavy **water wheel** inside the pipe; it takes effort to get it spinning, but once spinning, it keeps the water flowing even if you turn off the tap.

**6. Battery** is the **pump**.

- **Analogy:** The **water pump** that creates the pressure (Voltage) to move the water (Current).

7. **Conductor** is the **highway** (Material that lets electricity flow easily).

- **Analogy:** A **wide, smooth pipe** for water.
