A high-key, overexposed anime illustration in the style of modern Japanese lo-fi music videos.

SUBJECT: oreki from hyouka with messy black hair, wearing earphones and a loose hoodie, looking down at a smartphone.

ART STYLE: 
1. Line Art: The outlines must be THIN and COLORED DARK TEAL or SLATE GREY (strictly NO pure black lines). The lines should feel slightly sketchy, not vector-perfect.
2. Lighting: Extremely bright, "blown-out" white lighting. The image should look hazy and soft, with a strong "bloom" effect.
3. Coloring: Flat, desaturated pastel colors. Pale peach skin,  black hoodie. 
4. Shading: Minimal hard-edged cel shading. The shadows should be pale purple/grey, not black.
5. Details: Add distinctive, hard-edged "blob" white highlights on the hair and nose tip, exactly like the reference style.
6. Background: A blindingly bright, blurred white/pale blue street scene, almost invisible due to the light haze.

ATMOSPHERE: Melancholic, nostalgic, soft, flat 2D aesthetic.
