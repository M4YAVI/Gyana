 I’m not just listening, I’m actually catching the gist. That’s how I learn, maybe because I’m wired to process info faster. Obviously, learning isn’t the same as passively hearing. Certain ideas just click when they’re slightly accelerated. I’m not trying to force a rule; I just make sure I understand what’s relevant

If that sounds ridiculous, whatever, but it’s what works for me. I’ll keep doing it until it stops making sense.
