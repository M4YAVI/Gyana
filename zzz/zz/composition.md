## 1) Placement (where the subject sits)

- **Rule of Thirds**  
    Put the subject on the 1/3 lines or intersections.  
    **Use:** portraits, landscapes, street. When you want “natural” balance.  
    **Where:** basically everywhere. Turn on the 3x3 grid in-camera.
    
- **Centered Composition**  
    Subject dead center.  
    **Use:** strong faces, icons, simple scenes, calm vibes.  
    **Where:** portraits, architecture, product photos. Also when symmetry exists.
    
- **Symmetry**  
    Mirror-like balance left/right (or top/bottom).  
    **Use:** buildings, reflections, patterns.  
    **Where:** architecture, interiors, bridges, puddles after rain.
    
- **Golden Ratio / Golden Spiral**  
    Like rule of thirds, but curvier and more “flowy.”  
    **Use:** when the scene already has a curve/path.  
    **Where:** nature, food, still life. Don’t force it. Nobody’s grading you.
    
- **Rule of Odds (1, 3, 5)**  
    Odd numbers feel less stiff.  
    **Use:** groups, objects, product setups.  
    **Where:** food, still life, street scenes.
    
- **Triangle Composition**  
    Arrange subjects into a triangle. Feels stable and intentional.  
    **Use:** groups of people, poses, objects.  
    **Where:** portraits (2–3 people), still life, editorial.
    
- **Balance / Visual Weight**  
    Big bright thing on one side? Counter it with something smaller/darker on the other.  
    **Use:** when one side feels “heavy.”  
    **Where:** landscapes, street, travel.
    

## 2) Lines & paths (how the eye moves)

- **Leading Lines**  
    Roads, fences, shadows, rails pointing to the subject.  
    **Use:** to guide attention fast.  
    **Where:** streets, architecture, landscapes.
    
- **Diagonal Lines**  
    Adds energy and motion.  
    **Use:** action, dynamic scenes.  
    **Where:** sports, dance, street.
    
- **S-Curve**  
    Curvy line that pulls the eye gently through the frame.  
    **Use:** depth + elegance.  
    **Where:** rivers, roads, coastlines, posed bodies.
    
- **Converging Lines / Vanishing Point**  
    Lines meet in the distance. Instant depth.  
    **Use:** dramatic scale, “go somewhere” feeling.  
    **Where:** hallways, city streets, tunnels.
    

## 3) Framing (using the scene to frame the scene)

- **Frame Within a Frame**  
    Shoot through doors, windows, arches, branches.  
    **Use:** focus, depth, storytelling.  
    **Where:** street, portraits, travel.
    
- **Foreground Interest**  
    Put something in the front to add depth.  
    **Use:** landscapes that look flat.  
    **Where:** landscapes, city scenes. Rocks/flowers/railings work.
    
- **Layering (Foreground / Mid / Background)**  
    Multiple depth layers = instant “3D.”  
    **Use:** storytelling, depth, scale.  
    **Where:** street, travel, landscapes.
    
- **Edge Control**  
    Watch the borders. Don’t let bright junk pull attention.  
    **Use:** always.  
    **Where:** everywhere. Yes, even “quick” shots.
    

## 4) Space (how much breathing room)

- **Negative Space**  
    Lots of empty area around the subject.  
    **Use:** minimalism, loneliness, clean ads.  
    **Where:** portraits, product, architecture, sky-heavy scenes.
    
- **Fill the Frame**  
    Get closer. Make the subject dominate.  
    **Use:** impact, detail, less distraction.  
    **Where:** portraits, animals, street, macros.
    
- **Rule of Space (Lead Room)**  
    Leave space in front of moving subjects or where someone’s looking.  
    **Use:** motion, portraits with gaze direction.  
    **Where:** sports, street, portraits.
    

## 5) Patterns, texture, and “stuff that repeats”

- **Repetition / Pattern**  
    Repeating shapes/colors.  
    **Use:** satisfying visuals, structure.  
    **Where:** architecture, crowds, nature.
    
- **Break the Pattern**  
    One different thing in repetition = instant subject.  
    **Use:** make a subject obvious without trying hard.  
    **Where:** street, design, product.
    
- **Texture**  
    Texture becomes the subject.  
    **Use:** tactile, gritty, detailed looks.  
    **Where:** close-ups, architecture, portraits with character.
    

## 6) Perspective (camera position matters more than people admit)

- **High Angle**  
    Makes subjects smaller, vulnerable, or graphic.  
    **Use:** storytelling, patterns, crowds.  
    **Where:** street from above, events.
    
- **Low Angle**  
    Makes subjects bigger, stronger, dramatic.  
    **Use:** power, scale.  
    **Where:** portraits, architecture, cars.
    
- **Dutch Angle (tilted horizon)**  
    Adds tension/unease.  
    **Use:** chaos, edgy energy.  
    **Where:** music, skate, stylized street. Don’t overdo it unless you like complaints.
    

## 7) Depth & focus (what’s sharp is what matters)

- **Shallow Depth of Field (blurred background)**  
    Subject pops, background melts.  
    **Use:** portraits, messy locations.  
    **Where:** portraits, detail shots, street.
    
- **Deep Focus (everything sharp)**  
    Scene matters, not just one face.  
    **Use:** landscapes, architecture, storytelling scenes.  
    **Where:** travel, interiors.
    
- **Subject Separation**  
    Use light, color, or contrast to separate subject from background.  
    **Use:** whenever the subject blends in.  
    **Where:** always.
    

## 8) Color & tone (composition isn’t only shapes)

- **Complementary Colors** (blue/orange, red/green, etc.)  
    Strong pop and contrast.  
    **Use:** punchy visuals.  
    **Where:** street at night, portraits with wardrobe planning.
    
- **Analogous Colors** (neighbors on color wheel)  
    Smooth, calm harmony.  
    **Use:** soft mood.  
    **Where:** nature, lifestyle, interiors.
    
- **Color Accent (“one pop color”)**  
    Mostly neutral scene + one strong color.  
    **Use:** clear subject, graphic look.  
    **Where:** street, product.
    
- **Light/Dark Contrast (tonal contrast)**  
    Bright subject on dark background (or vice versa).  
    **Use:** instant attention control.  
    **Where:** portraits, stage, window light.
    
- **Silhouette**  
    Subject dark, background bright.  
    **Use:** simple shapes, drama, mystery.  
    **Where:** sunsets, windows, fog.
    

## 9) Timing & motion (composition, but with time)

- **Decisive Moment**  
    The exact gesture/step/look that sells the shot.  
    **Use:** street, sports, candid portraits.  
    **Where:** anywhere people move.
    
- **Motion Blur**  
    Blur shows movement.  
    **Use:** speed, energy.  
    **Where:** cars, crowds, dance.
    
- **Panning**  
    Subject sharp-ish, background streaks.  
    **Use:** motion + subject clarity.  
    **Where:** bikes, runners, cars.
    

## 10) Video / filmmaking composition basics (if you meant “camera” literally)

- **Headroom**  
    Don’t leave a gallon of space above heads.  
    **Use:** interviews, dialogue.  
    **Where:** any talking shot.
    
- **Looking Room (Eyeline space)**  
    Space in the direction they look.  
    **Use:** dialogue, interviews.  
    **Where:** always for people looking off camera.
    
- **180-Degree Rule**  
    Keep characters on consistent screen sides so it doesn’t feel flipped.  
    **Use:** conversations, action coverage.  
    **Where:** narrative, interviews with two people.
    
- **Shot Sizes (Wide / Medium / Close-up)**  
    Wide = context. Close = emotion/detail.  
    **Use:** mix them so it doesn’t feel flat.  
    **Where:** any sequence.
    

## The “must know” cheat checklist (fast, boring, effective)

1. **What’s the subject?** If it’s “everything,” it’s usually nothing.
2. **Background check.** Remove clutter. Move your feet.
3. **Edges check.** Don’t crop people at joints. Don’t let bright trash sit on the border.
4. **Horizon level.** Unless you _mean_ to tilt.
5. **Light decides the mood.** Put the subject in better light, not just “more” light.
6. **Get closer.** Then get closer again. Yes, even more.
