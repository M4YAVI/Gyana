so our narrator - basically melville himself, though he calls himself "tommo" - is on this whaling ship called the _dolly_. they've been at sea for like six months. everyone's miserable. the food is rotting, the captain sucks, the crew is ready to mutiny.

they finally pull into nuku hiva, this island in the marquesas. everyone's excited because they've been eating garbage and doing hard labor and now there's an island with fruit and women and a break from the ocean.

the narrator has this buddy named toby. they're both young sailors and they're both completely done with the ship. they decide to jump ship - just desert and hide in the island until the _dolly_ leaves without them.

**the escape**

so tommo and toby plan their escape. they grab some supplies - bread, cloth for trading, whatever they can stash. when the ship's crew goes ashore, they sneak off into the jungle.

their plan is to hide in the mountains until the ship gives up looking for them and sails away. then they'll come down and just... live on the island. maybe catch another ship later. maybe not. they haven't thought it through.

the jungle is brutal. it's raining, everything's wet, the terrain is steep and slippery. they're climbing ridges, falling down, getting cut up on rocks and plants. tommo's leg starts bothering him. it swells up. probably an infection or injury. it keeps getting worse throughout the story.

they're lost almost immediately. they have no idea where they are or where they're going. they're just trying to get away from the coast and avoid search parties.

**which valley?**

here's the problem: the island has different valleys with different tribes. some tribes are chill with foreigners. some are not.

there's the happars - they're supposed to be friendly. and there's the typees - they're rumored to be cannibals. hardcore ones. everyone's terrified of the typees.

tommo and toby are trying to reach the happar valley. they really don't want to end up with the typees.

they climb ridges, look down at valleys, try to figure out which is which. they can't tell. they're exhausted and starving and tommo's leg is getting worse.


**meeting the typees**

eventually they stumble down into a valley. they find a village. people come out to meet them.

and... it's the typees. the cannibals. the tribe everyone warned them about.

tommo and toby are terrified but trying not to show it. the typees seem friendly though. they're curious about these white guys who just appeared. they bring them food - breadfruit, coconut, fish. they're smiling and welcoming.

the chief is this old guy named mehevi. he seems cool. there's also this young woman named fayaway who's beautiful and becomes important later. and kory-kory, this guy who becomes tommo's personal servant/keeper.

**settling in**

so tommo and toby are stuck there. they can't leave because: 1) they don't know the way out, 2) tommo's leg is messed up, and 3) the typees won't let them go.

it's weird. the typees are super nice. they feed them, give them a house, treat them well. but they also won't let them leave. whenever tommo or toby try to go toward the beach or talk about leaving, the typees get agitated and block them.

so it's like... comfortable captivity? they're guests but also prisoners.

toby keeps trying to negotiate their release. the typees don't budge. they seem to want to keep these white guys around. maybe as curiosities. maybe for other reasons.

**toby leaves**

at some point, toby convinces the typees to let him go down to the beach to try to get medicine for tommo's leg. he says he'll come back. the typees are suspicious but they let him go with an escort.

toby leaves.

he never comes back.

tommo waits for days. nothing. he asks the typees where toby is. they give vague answers. they say he left on a boat. they say he's fine. tommo doesn't know if they're lying or if toby actually abandoned him or what.

so now tommo's alone with the typees. his leg is still bad. he can't walk well. he's completely dependent on them.

**life with the typees**

tommo spends weeks, maybe months with the typees. melville uses this time to describe everything about typee life in extreme detail.

---
he talks about their houses, their food, their tattoos, their religion, their social structure. he describes how they spend their days - mostly just hanging out, eating, swimming, sleeping. they don't work much. they seem happy.

kory-kory takes care of tommo. carries him around because of the bad leg. feeds him. they communicate mostly through gestures and broken words.

fayaway becomes tommo's companion. she's sweet and beautiful and they hang out constantly. there's definitely a romance thing happening but melville keeps it vague and proper because it's the 1840s.

tommo goes to feasts, watches their dances, learns their customs. he's fascinated by them but also constantly nervous because... cannibals.

**the cannibal question**

the whole time, tommo is trying to figure out if they actually eat people.

he sees suspicious packages wrapped in leaves. he sees them preparing something they won't let him look at. he hears about battles with the happars and wonders what happens to the bodies.

then one day he sees it. he stumbles into a place where they're preparing human remains. he sees a skull. he sees preserved heads. it's real. they actually do eat their enemies.

he freaks out internally but tries to stay calm. the typees notice he's upset and they kind of brush it off like it's no big deal.

after that, tommo is terrified. before, he thought maybe the cannibal stories were exaggerated. now he knows they're true. and he's trapped there with an infected leg and no way out.

**trying to escape**

tommo becomes obsessed with leaving. his leg isn't getting better. the typees are nice but he's scared they'll eventually decide to eat him. or keep him forever.

he tries to convince them to let him go to the beach. they refuse. he tries to sneak away. they catch him. they're getting more possessive and suspicious.

mehevi and the other chiefs keep him under watch. they're still friendly but firm. he's not leaving.

**the tattoo incident**

at one point, the typees try to tattoo tommo's face. this is a huge deal. getting tattooed means you're becoming one of them. permanently.

tommo absolutely refuses. he's terrified of being marked as a typee. if he gets tattooed, he can never return to western society. he'd be marked as someone who lived with cannibals.

he resists so strongly that they back off. but it's tense.

**boats arrive**

eventually, some boats show up near the bay. tommo hears about it. it's his chance to escape.

he begs the typees to let him go down to the beach. they refuse. he argues, pleads, gets desperate. they're unmoved.

kory-kory and the others are getting anxious. they know if tommo reaches those boats, he's gone.

**the escape**

tommo makes a run for it. despite his bad leg, he hobbles toward the beach as fast as he can. the typees chase him.

he reaches the water. there are boats from a ship offshore. he yells to them. they send a small boat to get him.

the typees are swarming around him. some are trying to grab him back. mehevi and others are there. it's chaos.

tommo jumps into the water and swims/limps toward the boat. the typees follow him into the water. one guy grabs him. tommo fights him off - actually strikes him with a boat hook or oar, something violent.

the sailors pull tommo into their boat. they row away fast. the typees are yelling from the shore. fayaway is there looking sad. kory-kory is there.

tommo escapes. barely.

**aftermath**

tommo gets picked up by this australian ship. he's safe but his leg is still messed up. he's traumatized from the whole experience.

he never finds out what happened to toby.

the book ends with him reflecting on the typees. despite everything - the captivity, the cannibalism, the fear - he admits they were kind to him. they're not savages. they're just... different. they have their own way of life.

he's critical of how westerners view polynesians. he points out that the typees were happier and more peaceful than most "civilized" people. yeah, they eat their enemies, but western nations do horrible things too.

it's this complicated ending where he's grateful to escape but also kind of misses them. especially fayaway.

**what it's really about**

the whole book is melville's critique of colonialism and western civilization. he's saying: who are we to call them savages? they're living peaceful, happy lives. we're the ones with wars and poverty and misery.

he's also just documenting polynesian life because most readers had never heard of these islands or people. it's part adventure story, part anthropology.

the cannibal stuff makes it sensational but the real point is cultural criticism.

also: tommo's leg never gets explained. it just hurts the whole time. some people think it's symbolic. some think melville actually injured his leg when he deserted his ship. who knows.

**the real story**

this is based on melville's actual life. he really did jump ship in the marquesas. he really did stay with the typees for a few weeks. he escaped. then he wrote this book and everyone thought he made it up because it seemed too wild.

toby actually showed up later after the book was published and confirmed the story. so it's mostly true. melville probably exaggerated some parts and added drama but the core is real.

anyway. that's typee. start to finish. one guy's month-long hostage situation with cannibals that's somehow also a vacation and a cultural study and an adventure novel all at once.

typical melville honestly.
