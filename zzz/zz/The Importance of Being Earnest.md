## Act 1: London — the first lie

The play opens in **Algernon Moncrieff’s flat in London**. Algernon is a young man who enjoys life, food, and avoiding responsibility. He is not very serious about anything.

His friend **Jack Worthing** arrives to visit him. Jack seems responsible and well‑behaved, but we soon learn something important:

- Jack lives in the countryside and pretends to be a serious guardian to a young woman named **Cecily**.
- To escape his boring country life, Jack has invented a fake younger brother named **Ernest** who lives in London and is always getting into trouble.
- Whenever Jack wants fun, he says, “I must go to London to help my brother Ernest,” and then he enjoys himself freely.
Algernon finds out about this secret and laughs—because **he does the same thing**.

- Algernon has invented an imaginary sick friend named **Bunbury** who lives in the countryside.
- Whenever Algernon wants to escape boring family duties, he says he must visit Bunbury.

They call this habit **“Bunburying”**—using fake people to avoid responsibility.

## Love enters the picture

Jack is in London for a reason: he is in love with **Gwendolen Fairfax**, who is Algernon’s cousin.

Gwendolen arrives with her mother, **Lady Bracknell**, a powerful, strict woman who cares deeply about social status, money, and family background.

Jack proposes to Gwendolen, and she happily accepts—but there is a catch:

> Gwendolen says she has _always_ dreamed of marrying a man named **Ernest**.

She loves Jack _because_ she believes his name is Ernest.

Jack panics internally—but does not correct her.

## Lady Bracknell’s interrogation

Lady Bracknell interviews Jack to see if he is suitable for marriage. She asks about:

- his income
- his habits
- his family background

Then Jack reveals a shocking truth:

- He was found as a baby **in a handbag at a train station**
- He does not know who his parents are

Lady Bracknell is horrified. A handbag is completely unacceptable.

She forbids the marriage and leaves with Gwendolen.

Before leaving, Algernon overhears that Jack has:

- a beautiful young ward
- a country house
- and a very comfortable life

Algernon becomes interested.

## Act 2: The countryside — more lies

The story moves to **Jack’s country estate**, where **Cecily** lives. Cecily is young, romantic, and imaginative. She spends her time studying and writing in her diary.

Algernon arrives unexpectedly, pretending to be **Jack’s troublesome brother Ernest**.

Cecily is thrilled—she has heard all about this “Ernest” and has already imagined falling in love with him.

Very quickly:

- Algernon (as Ernest) proposes
- Cecily accepts
- She explains that she has _already_ imagined their engagement and written it in her diary

Just like Gwendolen, Cecily says she could only love a man named **Ernest**.

Algernon, now deeply worried, decides he must be baptized and officially change his name to Ernest.

---

## Jack returns — chaos begins

Jack returns home, dressed in black, pretending that his fake brother Ernest has **died**.

Then Algernon walks in—alive—claiming to be Ernest.

Jack is furious, but he cannot reveal the truth without exposing his own lies.

Things get worse when **Gwendolen arrives**, having followed Jack to the countryside.

Soon after, **Cecily and Gwendolen meet**.

## The tea table disaster

At first, both women are polite but tense.

Then they discover something terrible:

- Cecily believes she is engaged to **Ernest Worthing**
- Gwendolen believes she is engaged to **Ernest Worthing**

They realize they are supposedly engaged to the same man.

Politeness disappears. They insult each other sweetly while serving tea very badly.

Finally, Jack and Algernon arrive, and the truth comes out:

- Neither man is actually named Ernest.
- Both have been lying.

The women are angry and leave together.

---

## Act 3: Truth, punishment, and revelations

Jack and Algernon admit everything. They promise to change their names to Ernest.

Lady Bracknell arrives, furious again.

She refuses to allow:

- Jack to marry Gwendolen
- Algernon to marry Cecily

Until she learns one thing:

**Cecily has a large fortune.**

Suddenly, Lady Bracknell is very supportive of Algernon’s engagement.

Jack refuses to allow it unless Lady Bracknell approves _his_ marriage to Gwendolen.

---

## The handbag mystery solved

Jack demands to know who his parents were.

Lady Bracknell remembers something:

- Many years ago, her sister lost a baby boy
- The baby disappeared in a **handbag at a train station**

Miss Prism—Cecily’s governess—confesses that she accidentally placed the baby in a handbag and a book in the baby carriage.

Jack realizes the truth:

- He is Lady Bracknell’s nephew
- He is Algernon’s **older brother**
- His real name, given at birth, was **Ernest**

---

## The ending

Everything suddenly works out perfectly:

- Jack’s name actually _is_ Ernest
- Both women get men named Ernest
- Lady Bracknell approves all marriages

Jack finally understands the joke of the whole story and says:

> He now knows the **importance of being earnest**—which means both being honest _and_ being named Ernest.

The play ends happily, with marriages arranged and lies forgiven.
