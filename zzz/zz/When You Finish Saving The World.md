### Setup

We meet **Evelyn**.  
She runs a domestic violence shelter.  
She thinks she’s very good at helping people.  
She is.  
She’s also exhausting.

She has a teenage son, **Ziggy**.  
He’s online a lot.  
He livestreams acoustic songs.  
People send him money.  
He thinks this makes him deep.  
It mostly makes him smug.

They live together.  
They talk past each other constantly.  
Both think the other one just doesn’t get it.  
They’re right.

### Ziggy’s World

Ziggy is big on the internet.  
Small in real life.

At school, there’s a girl named **Lila**.  
She’s smart.  
She’s guarded.  
She works at a local store.  
Ziggy decides he likes her.

He tries to connect.  
He talks about himself.  
A lot.  
He assumes his sensitivity is impressive.  
It is not.

Lila listens.  
Sometimes.  
Mostly she clocks out emotionally.

### Evelyn’s World

Evelyn runs the shelter like a mission.  
Helping women is her thing.  
She’s intense about it.

A new woman arrives with her kid.  
Evelyn latches on.  
She wants to _fix_ them.  
Especially the kid.

She also keeps comparing every teenage boy to Ziggy.  
Spoiler: she prefers the imaginary version of Ziggy in her head.

At home, she criticizes Ziggy constantly.  
His music.  
His internet fame.  
His values.  
She thinks he’s selfish.  
She’s not totally wrong.

---

### Parallel Messes

Ziggy keeps chasing Lila.  
He tries being “authentic.”  
He trauma-dumps.  
He performs vulnerability like it’s a song.

Lila doesn’t ask for any of this.  
She has real problems.  
Ziggy doesn’t really notice.

Meanwhile, Evelyn crosses boundaries at work.  
She inserts herself too much.  
She projects.  
She confuses control with care.

Both of them think they’re saving people.  
Both are mostly just feeding their own egos.

---

### Things Fall Apart (Softly)

Ziggy finally crosses a line with Lila.  
He says something cruel without meaning to.  
Because he wasn’t listening.  
She calls him out.  
She’s done.

He’s confused.  
He thought being “nice” was enough.  
It wasn’t.

Evelyn also hits a wall.  
The family she’s trying to save pushes back.  
Hard.  
They don’t want her version of help.

She’s shocked.  
She thought good intentions were bulletproof.  
They are not.

---

### Realizations (No Big Speeches)

Ziggy realizes his mom might have been right.  
A little.  
About him being self-centered.  
This annoys him deeply.

Evelyn realizes she treats her son like a project.  
Not a person.  
This bothers her.  
Quietly.

They don’t have a dramatic heart-to-heart.  
Of course not.  
This movie doesn’t do that.

---

### Ending

Ziggy performs again.  
But differently.  
Less polished.  
Less sure of himself.  
More honest.  
Still awkward.

Evelyn watches him.  
She doesn’t interrupt.  
That’s growth.  
Small, but real.

Nothing is fully fixed.  
No one is fully redeemed.  
They just see each other a little more clearly.

Which is apparently the win.

---

That’s it.  
Two people trying to save the world.  
Mostly tripping over themselves.  
Relatable.  
Kind of exhausting.

## The central lesson of the movie
#quotes
**Attention is not the same thing as meaning.**  
And chasing recognition instead of connection quietly ruins lives

> The most dangerous place is not failure — it’s _almost_ success.


> People fall in love with who you are _now_, not who you promise to become.

> **A meaningful life is built from attention you give, not attention you get.**
