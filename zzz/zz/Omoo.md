alright. omoo. melville's second book. basically the sequel to typee. let me walk you through this whole thing.

**the setup**

so the narrator (basically melville himself) is on this whaling ship called the _julia_. it's a mess. the ship is falling apart, the crew is half-dead from scurvy, and the captain - guy frost - is sick and useless. first mate is this guy named john jermin who's actually running things but he's kind of a jerk about it.

the ship is cruising around tahiti and the nearby islands. everyone's miserable. the narrator joined this crew after escaping from the marquesas (that's the typee story). he was hoping for better. he was wrong.

**the crew situation**

the crew is this weird mix of sailors from everywhere. there's long ghost, this tall creepy guy who becomes the narrator's buddy. he's super laid back and weird. there's doctor long ghost too - he's not actually a doctor but everyone calls him that. he's educated, sarcastic, kinda shady. he and the narrator team up basically.

the rest of the crew includes a bunch of random sailors, some polynesians, some europeans, all of them kind of done with this voyage. nobody wants to be there.

**things fall apart**

captain guy frost is getting worse. he's bedridden. jermin is in charge and he's pushing everyone hard. the ship needs repairs badly but they keep trying to hunt whales anyway. it's stupid.

they stop at tahiti to get supplies and maybe fix the ship. but when they're anchored there, the crew basically mutinies. well, sort of. they refuse to work. they're like "this ship sucks, the captain's dying, we're not doing this anymore."

**the consul**

so the consul shows up. this british guy named wilson. he's supposed to handle disputes with sailors and ships. he comes aboard to deal with the mutiny situation.

the crew lists their complaints: ship's falling apart, captain's incompetent, conditions are terrible, they want to be discharged. basically they want off this death trap.

wilson doesn't care. he sides with the officers. tells the crew to get back to work or face consequences. the narrator and like a dozen other guys refuse. they're done.

**jail time**

so wilson has them arrested. they get taken to this makeshift jail called the calabooza beretanee. it's not really a jail. it's this open-air bamboo structure. the "guard" is this chill old polynesian guy named bob who doesn't care what they do.

so the mutineers are just... hanging out in tahiti basically. under loose arrest. they can wander around during the day. bob doesn't stop them. it's the most relaxed imprisonment ever.

**tahiti life**

the narrator and doctor long ghost spend weeks just exploring tahiti. they meet locals, go to different villages, see how the tahitians live. melville uses this to describe tahitian culture in detail.

he talks about how the missionaries have changed everything. the tahitians used to have their own religion and customs but the christian missionaries came in and messed it all up. melville's pretty critical of this. he thinks the missionaries ruined a lot of good things and didn't really help the tahitians.

he describes the social structure, how the chiefs work, the role of the queen pomare, how colonialism is destroying traditional life. it's basically anthropology mixed with travel writing.

the french have also taken over parts of tahiti. there's tension between the tahitians, the french, the british missionaries, everyone. it's complicated political stuff that melville explains in his dry way.

**life in the calabooza**

meanwhile the guys in the calabooza are just living their best lazy lives. bob the guard lets them do whatever. they get food brought to them. they sleep outside. they flirt with local women. they're technically prisoners but it's more like a vacation.

some of the crew eventually give up and go back to the ship. the _julia_ needs to leave and jermin wants crew members. a few guys cave and rejoin. the narrator and long ghost and some others refuse.

eventually the _julia_ just leaves without them. the remaining mutineers are now free. their "punishment" is over because there's no ship to return to.

**moving around**

the narrator and doctor long ghost decide to explore more islands. they leave tahiti and go to imeeo (moorea), a nearby island.

they're basically broke wanderers now. they go village to village, sometimes getting food and shelter from locals, sometimes working odd jobs, mostly just existing.

they meet this guy zeke and his wife shorty. they're this weird couple running a plantation. zeke is trying to grow potatoes. it's not going well. the narrator and long ghost work for them briefly but it's a disaster. zeke is incompetent and the work sucks.

**working (barely)**

they try other jobs. they work on different plantations. they help with farming. nothing sticks. they're bad employees and the jobs are terrible. they keep moving around.

melville describes all these different tahitian and moorean villages they pass through. he talks about the people, the customs, the way colonialism is affecting everything. he's still critical of the missionaries throughout.

**the planters**

they meet various european planters and beachcombers - white guys who've settled in the islands. some are making a go of it, some are total failures. melville describes this whole cast of characters.

there's a section about the "kannakippers" - kind of like labor recruiters who exploit polynesian workers. melville doesn't like them.

**more wandering**

the narrator and long ghost keep drifting. they go to different bays, different villages. they're running out of money and options. they're not starving but they're definitely in that backpacker-who's-overstayed-their-visa territory.

they hear about opportunities on other islands. they talk about maybe getting on another whaling ship, maybe finding real work, maybe just moving on.

**parting ways**

eventually they end up in taloo, another part of moorea. there's some whaling ships around. the narrator decides he's ready to leave the islands and get back to proper sailing.

he and doctor long ghost split up. long ghost decides to stay in the islands. the narrator signs onto a new whaling ship. they say goodbye pretty casually. they've been travel buddies for months but neither of them gets emotional about it.

**the end**

the narrator joins the crew of a sydney-bound whaler. he's leaving tahiti and the society islands behind. the book ends with him sailing away, heading toward new adventures.

that's it. no dramatic climax. no big resolution. just melville wandering around tahiti for months, observing stuff, criticizing missionaries, hanging out with doctor long ghost, and eventually moving on.

**what's it actually about**

the whole book is really melville documenting polynesian life and complaining about colonialism. the "plot" is just him drifting around. but the real content is his observations about:

- how missionaries destroyed traditional culture
- how colonialism exploited the tahitians
- how the tahitians lived before and after european contact
- the politics between france, britain, and the local chiefs
- the various characters he meets

it's part adventure story, part ethnography, part social criticism. written in melville's rambling style where he'll go off on tangents about tahitian religion for ten pages then get back to the story.

way less exciting than typee. no cannibals, no dramatic escape. just a guy bumming around tahiti complaining about stuff and hanging with his weird tall friend.

but that's omoo. start to finish.
