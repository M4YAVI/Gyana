## The lazy prompt formula

**[Character block] + [Shot size] + [Angle] + [Lens look] + [Composition] + [Lighting] + [Background] + [Aspect ratio]**

### Character block (keep this constant for consistency)

- hair / eyes / outfit / accessories
- vibe (serious, smug, tired, etc.)
- art style words (anime, cel shading, clean lineart, etc.)

## Shot sizes (distance) — what to use, when

Use these exact phrases in prompts.

- **Extreme wide / Establishing shot**

## Lens “look” (optional, but helps)

Not real lenses, but the vibe works.

- **24mm wide**: dramatic perspective, big background
- **35mm**: natural but still cinematic
- **50mm**: balanced “normal”
- **85mm**: flattering portrait feel + background blur  
    Prompt add-ons: _“24mm wide-angle look”_, _“85mm portrait lens look, shallow depth of field, bokeh”_

---

## Composition add-ons (make it actually look designed)

- **Rule of thirds**: _“rule of thirds composition”_
- **Centered + symmetry**: _“centered composition, symmetrical framing”_
- **Negative space (room for text)**: _“lots of negative space, subject off-center”_
- **Leading lines**: _“leading lines toward the character”_
- **Silhouette**: _“strong silhouette, backlit”_

## Quick consistency tips (so your character stops shape-shifting)

- Reuse the same **character block** every time. Don’t rewrite it from scratch.
- Keep 3–5 “identity anchors”: hair, eyes, outfit, one accessory, one signature color.
- If your tool supports it: use **reference image**, **seed**, or a **character LoRA**.
- If your tool supports negatives: block common junk like extra fingers / weird hands.
