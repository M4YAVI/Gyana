"The Fog Horn"—this is one of Bradbury's most beautiful and melancholy stories. It's got this incredible sadness to it that just stays with you. 

The story is set in a lighthouse way out on the coast, miles from anywhere. It's late autumn, November specifically, and our narrator is a man named Johnny who works at this lighthouse with an older man named McDunn. McDunn has been working at this lighthouse for years and years—he knows it inside and out, knows the sea, knows everything about this isolated place.

The story opens with the two of them up in the lighthouse on a cold, foggy night. When the fog rolls in thick like this, which it does often, the lighthouse has this massive fog horn that blows automatically. It's an enormous, deep, lonely sound that echoes out across the water to warn ships away from the rocks. Johnny describes it as this mournful, sad sound—almost like a cry.

McDunn, who's the older and wiser of the two, starts telling Johnny a story. He's been waiting for this particular night to share something with him, something strange and incredible that happens once a year.

He tells Johnny that the fog horn sounds like a living thing when it calls out. It sounds lonely, he says, like some huge animal crying out into the darkness, looking for something. Looking for an answer that never comes.

Then McDunn reveals why they're really waiting up tonight. He tells Johnny that every year, around this time, something comes to the lighthouse. Something from deep in the ocean.

And sure enough, as they're standing there in the cold, looking out at the fog and the dark water, they see something emerging from the depths. At first it's just a shape, huge and dark, rising up from the ocean. Water cascades off it. And then they see it clearly—it's a dinosaur. A genuine prehistoric sea creature, something like what we'd call a plesiosaur or sea serpent, though Bradbury doesn't get too specific with scientific names. It's absolutely massive, with a long neck, a huge body, eyes that are ancient and lonely.

Johnny is terrified at first, but McDunn isn't scared. He's seen this before. He explains that this creature has been coming to the lighthouse for years now, every year around the same time. It started coming about three years ago.

And here's where the story gets really heartbreaking. McDunn explains what he thinks is happening. This creature is probably the last of its kind. Maybe millions of years ago, there were others like it, but over the eons they all died out. This one survived somehow, sleeping in the deepest trenches of the ocean where no one could find it, where it's been alone for countless ages.

Then one day, it heard something. The fog horn. And to this ancient creature, that deep, mournful sound of the fog horn sounds like another one of its kind calling out. It thinks it's finally found another creature like itself. After millions of years of being alone, it thinks there's finally someone else out there.

So it comes. Every year it rises from the depths and swims to the lighthouse, answering the call it thinks is coming from one of its own kind.

As they watch, the creature circles the lighthouse. It calls out—and its voice is remarkably similar to the fog horn, that same deep, resonant, lonely sound. The fog horn sounds back automatically, because that's what it does. And the creature seems almost happy. It's like watching someone finally find a companion after an eternity of loneliness.

McDunn and Johnny watch this incredible scene unfold. The creature keeps circling, keeps calling, and the fog horn keeps responding. McDunn explains that the creature will stay for a while, and then eventually, when the sun starts to rise, it'll go back down into the depths. It does this every year—comes, spends time near what it thinks is another of its kind, then leaves, only to return again the next year.

But then something changes. Something goes wrong.

The fog horn suddenly switches off. It's on an automatic timer, and its scheduled time ends, so it just stops blowing. Suddenly there's silence. The creature waits. It calls out again, that plaintive, lonely sound echoing across the water. But the fog horn doesn't answer anymore.

The creature calls again, more insistently. Still nothing. You can feel its confusion, its desperation. It came all this way, and now the thing it thought was responding to it has gone silent.

And then the creature's mood changes. McDunn and Johnny can see it happening. The loneliness turns to something else—frustration, maybe anger, maybe grief, or maybe all of those things mixed together. This creature has been tricked. What it thought was another living being like itself is just a machine, just a cold tower with a horn. It's still alone. It's always been alone.

The creature attacks the lighthouse.

It rises up out of the water and crashes against the tower with incredible force. McDunn and Johnny barely have time to react. The creature is massive and powerful, and it's expressing millions of years of loneliness and pain in this moment. It smashes against the lighthouse again and again. Its tail whips through the water, creating enormous waves. It rams the structure with its body.

The two men have to evacuate. They're scrambling, trying to get out before the whole thing comes down. The creature keeps attacking, and the lighthouse starts to crumble. The fog horn apparatus, the light, everything is being destroyed.

They manage to get away just in time, watching from a safe distance as the creature demolishes the lighthouse in its rage and heartbreak. It's not really attacking them—it's attacking what deceived it, what gave it false hope.

After it destroys the lighthouse, the creature stays for a while longer, circling the ruins. Then, as the sun begins to rise, it gives one last long, mournful call—a sound of utter loneliness—and it sinks back down into the depths of the ocean, disappearing into the darkness where it came from.

The story ends with them rebuilding the lighthouse. They construct a new one, with a new fog horn. And McDunn says something really poignant—he wonders if the creature will come back next year. Will it remember? Will it be angry still, or will it have forgotten and come back again, hoping once more to find another of its kind?

He also says that maybe they should leave the ruins there as a kind of gravestone. Not for the creature, because it's not dead, but as a marker for its species, for all the others that are gone. A memorial to loneliness itself.

The story is incredibly moving because it's really about isolation and the desperate need for connection. This creature has been alone longer than we can even imagine—longer than human civilization has existed, longer than our species has walked the earth. And when it finally thinks it's found someone else, it turns out to be a trick, not intentional but a trick nonetheless. It's still alone.

Bradbury makes us feel tremendous sympathy for this monster. It's not evil or dangerous by nature—it's just lonely beyond measure, and that loneliness finally breaks it. The fog horn, this human invention meant to protect and warn, accidentally becomes the cruelest thing imaginable to this creature: a false promise of companionship.

The story also makes you think about humanity's place in the world. We build our lighthouses and fog horns, and we think we understand everything, but there are ancient things in the world—in the ocean, in the earth—that we know nothing about. Things that have their own stories, their own sorrows, that exist completely outside of our awareness.

It's a story about loneliness, about the pain of being the last of your kind, and about how sometimes the saddest thing isn't being forgotten—it's thinking you've finally been found, only to discover you're still utterly alone.
