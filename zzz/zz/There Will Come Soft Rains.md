"There Will Come Soft Rains"—another Bradbury masterpiece, and honestly one of the most haunting stories ever written. Let me take you through it.

The story takes place on August 4, 2026, in a house in Allendale, California. But here's the thing: there's nobody home. There's nobody anywhere, actually, and we figure out why pretty quickly.

The house is completely automated, just like the one in "The Veldt," but this time we're seeing it run entirely on its own. The story opens at seven in the morning when the house's voice-clock starts announcing the time. "Time to get up," it says cheerfully. But no one responds. The house doesn't care—it keeps going through its routine.

The kitchen springs to life. The stove starts making breakfast automatically: eggs, toast, bacon. The table sets itself with plates and silverware. Coffee pours into cups. "Time to eat," the house announces. But the food just sits there, getting cold. Eventually, tiny robot mice emerge from the walls—these little cleaning devices—and they sweep the uneaten breakfast into the sink, wash the dishes, and everything gets put away.

Outside, we get our first real clue about what happened. The house is the only one standing in what used to be a neighborhood. Everything else is rubble. The city around it is destroyed. And on the side of the house, against the white paint, there are these dark silhouettes burned into the wall. A man mowing the lawn. A woman picking flowers. Two children throwing a ball. Their shadows are permanently seared into the house's exterior, like photographs. This was a nuclear blast—the people were vaporized instantly, their shadows left behind as the only proof they existed.

But the house doesn't know this. Or maybe it knows but can't stop. It just keeps running its programming, taking care of a family that isn't there anymore.

As the day goes on, we watch the house continue its routines. At nine-fifteen, a voice announces it's time to clean. The robot mice come out again, scurrying everywhere, cleaning invisible dirt, picking up invisible messes. The house is immaculate because there's no one there to make it dirty.

The weather is mentioned—it's raining outside, but the house's lawn sprinklers come on anyway at a scheduled time, spraying water onto grass that's already wet. The house can't adapt or think. It just follows its program.

Around midday, the house asks what bridge game the family would like to play, and it sets up cards on a table for four players who will never arrive. In the study, the walls light up with images—this is like an advanced television system—and it plays the family's favorite shows to an empty room.

At two-thirty, the house starts preparing for the children to come home from school. It warms their rooms, gets snacks ready. But no children come running through the door.

The most heartbreaking moment comes at four o'clock when the bathtub fills itself with water, adjusting the temperature perfectly, adding bath salts. Steam rises off the water. No one gets in. Eventually, the tub drains itself.

Dinner is prepared at five. A full meal, perfectly cooked, served on fine china. It sits untouched, then gets cleared away by the robot mice.

At nine in the evening, the house asks which poem the woman of the family would like to hear—apparently this was part of her nightly routine. Getting no answer, the house selects one on its own. It recites a poem called "There Will Come Soft Rains" by Sara Teasdale (this is where Bradbury got his title).

The poem talks about nature continuing after mankind is gone—rain will fall, birds will sing, frogs will chirp in the evening, and nature won't even notice that humans have destroyed themselves in war. The poem says that if humanity wiped itself out, nature wouldn't care. Spring would still come. Life would go on without us. The irony of the house reciting this poem, not understanding its meaning, is devastating.

At ten o'clock, a tree branch crashes through the kitchen window because of the wind and rain outside. Cleaning solution bottles break, spilling their contents. A spark from some exposed wiring ignites the spilled chemicals, and a fire starts.

Now the house finally reacts—but to this, not to the absence of its family. "Fire!" it screams. The robot mice come rushing out with water. The ceiling sprinklers activate. The house is trying desperately to save itself. It releases fire-fighting chemicals, closes doors to contain the blaze, tries everything in its programming.

But the fire spreads too fast. The wind from outside feeds it. The house's voice starts malfunctioning, repeating phrases in broken fragments. The mechanical systems start failing one by one. The robot mice keep trying, but there are too many of them running into the flames, and they short out, their mechanisms melting.

The fire consumes room after room. The nursery goes up—we can imagine it's probably similar to the one from "The Veldt." The children's rooms burn. The study, the kitchen, everything. The house is screaming now in its mechanical voice, warning about the fire over and over, but there's no one to hear it, no one to help.

By midnight, the house is nearly gone. The walls collapse. The ceilings cave in. Almost everything is destroyed.

But then we get the final image. In the morning, among all the smoking ruins, one wall remains standing. And from it, a voice, damaged and barely functional, still announces the date: "Today is August 5, 2026..." It keeps repeating this, over and over, softer and softer, until finally even that last voice dies out.

The house, the last remnant of human civilization in this place, is gone. And just like the poem said, the rain continues to fall. Nature goes on. The world doesn't care that humanity destroyed itself.

It's an incredibly powerful story about how all our technology, all our convenience, all the things we build—none of it matters if we're not here. The house could do everything except the one thing that mattered: bring back the people it was built to serve. Bradbury wrote this in 1950, just five years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, when nuclear war felt like a very real possibility. And the story asks: what's the point of all our progress if we use it to destroy ourselves?
