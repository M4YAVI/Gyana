alright. bartleby. melville wrote this after moby-dick flopped and he was broke and bitter. it shows.

**the narrator:**

there's this old lawyer on wall street. he's telling the story. never named.

he's super proud of being boring. talks about how he's unambitious and avoids conflict. thinks this makes him wise.

runs a small law office. does boring paperwork for rich people. conveyancing, bonds, mortgages. nothing exciting. he likes it that way.

he mentions he once worked for john jacob astor, the rich dead guy. brings it up constantly like it's impressive. it's not.

**the office setup:**

his office has two rooms separated by a glass door. there are windows but they face brick walls. no real view of anything.

one window looks at a wall three feet away. the other looks into a shaft between buildings. it's depressing.

he has two employees already when the story starts:

**turkey:**

older guy. maybe sixty. english. has a drinking problem.

works great in the morning. after lunch he's drunk. gets red in the face. spills ink. makes mistakes. gets aggressive.

the lawyer keeps suggesting he take afternoons off. turkey refuses. gets offended.

every afternoon is a disaster but the lawyer won't fire him because the mornings are productive.

**nippers:**

younger guy. maybe twenty-five. ambitious. angry at the world.

opposite problem from turkey. terrible in the morning. good in the afternoon.

he's in debt. has indigestion. constantly adjusting his desk height trying to get comfortable.

wears fashionable clothes he can't afford. works side hustles. kind of a mess.

has these periods where he grinds his teeth and gets nothing done.

**ginger nut:**

twelve-year-old office boy. his dad sent him there to learn law stuff.

mostly he just goes and gets cakes for turkey and nippers. that's his job.

they call him ginger nut because that's the cake he buys most.

he's just a kid watching all these dysfunctional adults. probably traumatized.

**why bartleby:**

the lawyer's getting more business. needs another copyist. puts an ad out.

bartleby shows up. "pallidly neat, pitiably respectable, incurably forlorn."

young guy. pale. quiet. looks sad.

the lawyer hires him immediately. doesn't really interview him or anything.

**the first days:**

bartleby works behind a screen in the corner by one of those depressing windows facing a brick wall.

at first he copies documents constantly. doesn't talk. doesn't stop. just writes.

the lawyer's impressed. finally an employee who just works.

but bartleby never leaves his little corner. doesn't interact with the others. just sits there copying.

**"i would prefer not to":**

the lawyer calls bartleby to help examine a document. it's normal office work. you copy something, then someone reads it aloud while you check your copy for errors.

bartleby says: "i would prefer not to."

not angry. not apologetic. just... states it.

the lawyer's confused. asks again. same response. "i would prefer not to."

he doesn't refuse exactly. doesn't say he won't. just prefers not to.

the lawyer's so baffled he just lets it go.

**the pattern:**

this becomes bartleby's thing. whenever asked to do anything besides copying, he says "i would prefer not to."

- proof-read documents? prefer not to.
- run an errand? prefer not to.
- do literally anything? prefer not to.

the lawyer keeps trying. keeps getting the same response. never fires him.

turkey and nippers get mad. they're doing extra work because bartleby won't. but bartleby doesn't care. just sits there.

**the discovery:**

one sunday the lawyer stops by the office. finds out bartleby's living there.

there's evidence everywhere. soap, towel, blanket. bartleby's been sleeping at the office.

the lawyer realizes bartleby has no home. no family. no life outside this office.

just lives behind that screen staring at a brick wall.

the lawyer feels bad. tries to figure out bartleby's story. bartleby won't talk about it.

**the decline:**

bartleby stops copying. just stares at the wall.

the lawyer asks him to work. "i would prefer not to."

asks him to leave. "i would prefer not to."

bartleby just... exists there. does nothing. won't leave.

the lawyer tries everything:

- reasoning with him. doesn't work.
- offering money. bartleby won't take it.
- asking nicely. nothing.
- asking firmly. nothing.
- getting angry. bartleby doesn't react.

he's not hostile. not defensive. just quietly refuses everything.

**the lawyer's problem:**

the lawyer can't handle conflict. it's his whole thing.

he should just fire bartleby and force him out. but he can't do it.

feels sorry for him. feels responsible. doesn't want to cause a scene.

keeps making excuses. "i'll deal with it tomorrow." tomorrow comes. he doesn't deal with it.

turkey and nippers are furious. there's this guy getting paid to stare at a wall.

**the rationalization:**

the lawyer starts thinking bartleby's there for a reason. maybe god sent him as a test of charity.

convinces himself keeping bartleby is the christian thing to do.

reads religious texts about tolerance and charity. feels good about himself.

his friends think he's crazy. clients start noticing this weird pale guy who just stands around.

**the breaking point:**

the lawyer finally admits this can't continue. his reputation's suffering.

decides to move offices. just abandons bartleby there.

finds a new place. moves everything. leaves bartleby behind.

feels guilty but also relieved. problem solved.

**not solved:**

the new tenants find bartleby. he's still there. sitting on the stairs. haunting the building.

they complain to the lawyer. it's his employee. his problem.

the lawyer's like "not my problem anymore. i moved."

they threaten to call the cops. the lawyer panics. goes back.

**the confrontation:**

lawyer finds bartleby sitting on the building's stairs.

offers him money. offers him other jobs. offers to take him home with him.

bartleby: "i would prefer not to."

to everything. every offer. just prefers not to.

he's not angry. not grateful. not anything. just completely checked out.

the lawyer gives up. leaves. feels terrible.

**the arrest:**

the new tenants call the police. bartleby won't leave. they arrest him.

vagrancy. he's literally just existing in a building he won't leave.

they take him to the tombs. the prison in new york.

the lawyer hears about it. feels guilty. visits him.

**the prison:**

bartleby's in this outdoor area at the prison called the tombs. high walls. prisoners just standing around.

the lawyer visits. tries to talk to him. bartleby won't engage.

lawyer bribes a guy who works there to give bartleby good food.

bartleby refuses to eat. just stands facing a wall.

says he prefers not to eat.

**the end:**

the lawyer visits again. finds bartleby dead.

he's lying curled up at the base of a wall. starved himself.

just... gave up. stopped participating in life completely.

the lawyer's devastated. reflects on what happened.

**the epilogue:**

the lawyer heard a rumor about bartleby's past. can't confirm it but shares it anyway.

apparently bartleby worked at the dead letter office. the place where undeliverable mail goes.

he spent his days sorting letters that never reached anyone. reading fragments of other people's lost connections.

money that never arrived. love letters that never got delivered. news that came too late.

job that would destroy anyone's faith in human connection.

the lawyer thinks this explains bartleby. the job broke him.

story ends with: "ah bartleby! ah humanity!"

which is melville's way of saying this is about more than one weird guy.

**what's actually happening:**

okay so this is melville processing some stuff.

he'd just failed as a writer. moby-dick was ignored. his career was dead. he was doing customs work to survive.

bartleby is basically melville saying "i've given up but i'm too polite to say so."

but it's also about:

- depression and mental illness
- dehumanizing office work
- urban isolation
- how capitalism grinds people down
- the limits of charity
- passive resistance

**the lawyer as narrator:**

the lawyer thinks he's the good guy. keeps emphasizing how patient and kind he is.

but he's actually kind of the villain. employs these damaged people. pays them badly. ignores their problems until it affects him.

with bartleby he wants credit for caring without actually doing anything effective.

melville's showing how "nice" people enable suffering by avoiding confrontation.

**bartleby's resistance:**

"i would prefer not to" becomes this radical act.

he's not attacking the system. not arguing. just... opting out.

won't participate. won't explain. won't justify himself.

it's passive resistance that no one knows how to handle.

you can fight aggression. you can't fight someone who just quietly refuses everything.

**the office as prison:**

the setting matters. windows facing brick walls. divided rooms. artificial light.

these guys are already imprisoned before bartleby goes to actual prison.

they're all trapped in meaningless work. copying documents no one will read.

bartleby just makes it obvious.

**the other employees:**

turkey and nippers are also broken by the work. they just cope differently.

turkey drinks. nippers has rage and anxiety. both are miserable.

but they keep performing. keep pretending it's fine.

bartleby stops pretending. that's what makes him dangerous.

**the dead letter office:**

whether this backstory is true or not, it's perfect.

bartleby's previous job was literally handling failed communication. messages that never connected people.

now he won't communicate at all. full circle.

melville suggesting modern work destroys our ability to connect.

**the walls:**

every description mentions walls. brick walls outside windows. the screen around bartleby's desk. prison walls.

everyone's walled off. isolated. trapped.

the story's claustrophobic. no escape. no real outside world.

**interpretations:**

people read this as:

- allegory about christ (suffering innocent)
- depression narrative
- critique of capitalism
- absurdist fiction before absurdism existed
- commentary on slavery (passive resistance)
- melville's autobiography (artist who gives up)

it's all of these. none of these. melville leaves it open.

**why it matters:**

it's like 50 pages but it's haunting.

bartleby doesn't do anything dramatic. just slowly stops existing.

and everyone around him is helpless. no solution. no fixing it.

the lawyer tries kindness, bribery, anger, abandonment. nothing works.

because bartleby doesn't want anything. can't be reached.

**the language:**

melville keeps it simple here. no whale tangents.

just this growing dread. slow realization something's very wrong.

the repetition of "i would prefer not to" becomes like a horror movie phrase.

starts polite. becomes terrifying. this person who just... won't.

**the ending:**

bartleby dies alone. starves himself. no one saves him.

the lawyer feels bad but moves on. probably hires another scrivener.

turkey and nippers keep drinking and raging.

nothing changes except one guy's gone.

melville's point: the system doesn't care. will keep grinding up bartlebys forever.

**modern relevance:**

this story predicted burnout culture.

bartleby's every millennial who's like "i can't even" but in 1853.

quiet quitting before that was a term.

just a guy who stopped participating and society couldn't handle it.

that's bartleby. melville wrote a horror story about a guy who politely gives up. no ghosts needed. just capitalism and depression and walls.

most unsettling thing he ever wrote. and he wrote about a whale destroying everyone.
