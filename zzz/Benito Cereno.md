fine. here is benito cereno. it is a story about a guy who is bad at reading the room.

**the setup**  
it is 1799. captain amasa delano is an american sailor off the coast of chile. he is nice but kind of slow. he sees a spanish ship called the _san dominick_ drifting around. it looks terrible. sails are torn. looks like a ghost ship.

delano decides to go help. he takes a small boat and some supplies. he thinks he is being a hero.

**on the ship**  
delano gets on board. the place is a mess. there are a lot of black slaves roaming around freely. not many spanish sailors left.

he meets the captain, benito cereno. cereno looks awful. he is sick, shaky, and can barely stand up. he is constantly followed by his servant, babo. babo is small and quiet and holds cereno up when he almost faints.

cereno tells delano a long, sad story. he says they hit terrible storms. most of the crew died of scurvy. the slaves’ master, alexandro aranda, died of fever. delano believes every word because he is gullible.

**the long, awkward day**  
delano hangs out on the ship all day waiting for the wind to pick up. things are weird.

1. the slaves are polishing hatchets. delano asks why. cereno says it is "busy work." delano buys it.
2. a spanish sailor tries to show delano a jewel.
3. an old sailor hands delano a complicated knot and tells him to "cut it." delano just thinks the guy is crazy.
4. a giant slave named atufal shows up in chains. cereno asks for the key. babo says he threw it away. it is theater. delano thinks it is just discipline.

delano starts getting paranoid. but he gets paranoid about the wrong thing. he thinks cereno is a pirate or a fake who plans to kill him. he thinks babo is the only nice person there.

**the shaving scene**  
this is the big metaphor part. babo shaves cereno in the cabin. he uses the spanish flag as a bib, which is disrespectful. delano thinks it is just an accident. babo accidentally cuts cereno’s neck. cereno shakes with fear. delano thinks cereno is just nervous because of the "mutiny" plot against the americans. he still doesn't get it.

**the escape**  
finally, delano’s boat comes back to pick him up. he says goodbye. he feels bad for misjudging cereno.

as delano steps into his boat, cereno suddenly jumps in after him.  
then babo jumps in too, holding a dagger.

delano—who is still clueless—thinks babo is trying to save his master. he tries to push cereno away. then he sees babo trying to stab cereno.

finally, it clicks. the slaves took over the ship ages ago. cereno was a hostage. babo was the leader. the whole day was an act to fool delano so they could steal his supplies or ship.

**the fight**  
delano’s men pull babo off. the canvas covering the ship’s figurehead falls off. underneath is the skeleton of the ship's owner, aranda. someone wrote "follow your leader" under it. it is grim.

the americans chase the spanish ship. they board it. they fight the slaves. the americans win.

**the legal stuff**  
the book switches to a boring court deposition. it explains everything linearly.  
the slaves revolted days before delano arrived. babo ordered them to kill most of the spaniards. they kept cereno alive to navigate. they forced him to play the role of captain whenever other ships were around. babo was whispering threats in his ear the whole time.

**the end**  
babo is executed. they cut off his head and put it on a pole.  
cereno is traumatized. he retires to a monastery.  
delano tries to cheer him up later, saying "hey, at least we survived."  
cereno says a shadow is hanging over him. "the negro."  
cereno dies a few months later.

so yeah. the american was oblivious, the spaniard was broken, and the servant was actually the boss. nobody wins. end of story.
