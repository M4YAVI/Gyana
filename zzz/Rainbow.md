A rainbow happens because of three things: refraction, reflection, and dispersion.

When sunlight hits a raindrop, it slows down and bends as it enters the water. This is **refraction**. Once inside, the light hits the back of the drop and bounces back, which is **reflection**. As it leaves the drop, it bends again. Because white light is actually made of different colors, each color bends at a slightly different angle. This separates them into the spectrum you see. That’s **dispersion**.

Essentially: Light enters water -> Bends -> Bounces -> Bends again -> Colors separate.


**Reflection**Light hits a surface and **bounces back**.
Seeing your face in a mirror.

**Refraction**Light goes through a surface and **changes direction**.

That image is a great summary, but it simplifies a few things about how light actually behaves.

 Not all light reflects.** In fact, most of the light actually passes straight through the droplet and exits out the back. Here is the reality of what happens inside that water drop:

### 1. Partial Reflection vs. Total Reflection

The image shows all the light bouncing off the back, but in real life, a water drop doesn't act like a perfect mirror.

- **Most light escapes:** When light hits the back of the drop, the majority (often over 90%) simply **refracts** out the back and disappears into the sky where you can't see it.
    
- **Only some reflects:** A smaller portion of the light **reflects** back toward you to form the rainbow you see.
    
- **It is not "Total Internal Reflection":** You might hear that term, but it's technically incorrect for primary rainbows. Total internal reflection only happens at very sharp angles; for a rainbow, it's just a standard "partial" reflection.
    

### 2. Is the diagram accurate?

The diagram is **functionally accurate** because it shows the specific path light _must_ take for you to see a rainbow.

- It correctly shows the order: **Refraction → Reflection → Refraction**.
    
- It correctly shows **Dispersion**, where red light bends the least and blue/violet light bends the most.
    

### 3. What if it reflects again?

If that small amount of light that reflected once hits the _front_ of the drop and bounces a **second time** before exiting, it creates a **secondary rainbow**. This is why double rainbows are much fainter—you are seeing a "reflection of a reflection," and most of the light has already been lost.

Think of it like a glass window: you can see through it (transmission/refraction), but you can also see a faint reflection of yourself (reflection). A rainbow is just us looking at that faint reflection.
