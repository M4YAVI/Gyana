# Best for chatgpt

{}  raw traditional ink sketch, analog style on rough grain paper. Drawn with a messy G-pen and India ink. The art style features frenetic, scratchy, and loose gestural lines with uneven weight. High contrast black and white. Areas of shadow are filled with heavy, scribbled solid black ink blocks, while lighter areas use thin, broken, jittery contour lines. Unrefined, sketchy aesthetic, kinetic energy, visible paper texture background, manga concept art, unpolished draftsmanship, monochromatic.
