- **Superposition:** Linear combinations of basis states ($|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$)
    
- **Interference:** Constructive and destructive phases
    
- **Entanglement:** Bell states and non-locality (The "Spooky action")
    
- **No-Cloning Theorem:** Why you can't copy a qubit (Critical for quantum cryptography)
