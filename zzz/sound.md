Sound travels at about 340 meters per second.

The first thing you’ve got to wrap your head around is **Mediums and Pressure**. Think of air like a giant room full of ping pong balls. Sound is just you hitting one ball, which hits the next, and so on. If there are no balls (a vacuum), there’s no sound. This explains why sound moves differently through water or a wall than it does through the air; some "balls" are packed tighter than others.

frequency is how often you swing back and forth, and amplitude is how high you're actually going.

Men generally have longer and thicker vocal cords. - low pitch.
Women generally have shorter, thinner vocal cords - high pitch.
**Vibration Speed** (frequency) → **What You Hear** (pitch).
**Amplitude** (Volume).

When you say "lower your pitch," you're technically telling them to make their voice sound deeper, like Batman
