the moment early humans realized that striking a stone at a certain angle could sharpen it, or that throwing a spear required accounting for an arc (gravity)

### **Era 1: Intuitive Physics (Survival & Tools)**

_Humans learn to manipulate matter and energy for survival. There is no math yet, only trial and error._

- **~3.3 Million Years Ago:** **First Stone Tools (The Wedge & Lever)**
    - Early hominids (like _Australopithecus_) use stones to smash bones. They unconsciously apply the physics of **stress** and **fracture mechanics** to create sharp edges (the first simple machines).
- **~1 Million Years Ago:** **Control of Fire (Thermodynamics)**
    - Humans (likely _Homo erectus_) discover how to maintain and use fire. This is the first practical application of **heat energy** and chemical transformation (roasting food).
- **~400,000 BCE:** **Projectile Weapons (Aerodynamics)**
    - The invention of spears involves understanding **projectile motion** and **center of mass** to ensure the weapon flies straight and hits with force.
- **~10,000 BCE:** **The Bow and Arrow (Elastic Potential Energy)**
    - Humans master the storage of energy. By bending a bow, they store **potential energy** and release it as **kinetic energy** into the arrow.


### **Era 2: Ancient Engineering (The Rise of Kingdoms)**

_As civilizations (Kingdoms) rise, humans use physics to build structures and track the stars. This is "Applied Physics."_

- **~3500 BCE:** **The Wheel (Rotational Mechanics)**
    - Invented in Mesopotamia. This revolutionizes transport by reducing **friction**.
- **~2500 BCE:** **The Pyramids of Giza (Statics & Simple Machines)**
    - Egyptians use **inclined planes (ramps)**, **levers**, and **rollers** to move massive stones. They demonstrate a mastery of **statics** (keeping heavy structures from collapsing).
- **~2000 BCE:** **Babylonian Astronomy (Observational Physics)**
    - Priests in Mesopotamia record the motion of planets and stars. They recognize patterns in the sky, laying the groundwork for **astrophysics** and timekeeping.

### **Era 3: Natural Philosophy (The Birth of Formal Physics)**

_The Greeks begin asking "Why?" instead of just "How?" They try to explain nature without using gods._

- **~585 BCE:** **Thales of Miletus**
    - Considered the "Father of Science." He proposes that natural events have natural causes (not spirits). He is the first to study **magnetism** (using lodestones) and **static electricity** (rubbing amber).
- **~400 BCE:** **Democritus (Atomism)**
    - Theorizes that the universe is made of tiny, indivisible particles called _atomos_ (atoms) moving in a void.
- **~350 BCE:** **Aristotle**
    - Writes the book _Physics_. Although many of his ideas were later proven wrong (like "heavy objects fall faster"), he establishes physics as a logical system of studying motion and elements.
- **~250 BCE:** **Archimedes (Mechanics & Fluids)**
    - The first true mathematical physicist. He explains **levers** ("Give me a place to stand, and I will move the Earth") and discovers **buoyancy** (Archimedes' Principle).

### **Era 4: The Middle Ages & Islamic Golden Age (Optics & Motion)**

_While Europe slows down, scholars in the Middle East preserve and expand physics._

- **1021 CE:** **Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen)**
    - The "Father of Optics." He proves that light travels in straight lines and enters the eye (rather than shooting out of it). He is arguably the first to use the **Scientific Method** of testing hypotheses with experiments.

### **Era 5: The Scientific Revolution (Classical Physics)**

_Physics becomes mathematical. The old ideas of Aristotle are overthrown._

- **1543:** **Nicolaus Copernicus**
    - Publishes the theory that the Earth revolves around the Sun (**Heliocentrism**), shifting our understanding of the universe's structure.
- **1609:** **Galileo Galilei (Kinematics)**
    - Uses a telescope to view moons orbiting Jupiter. He proves that all objects fall at the same rate regardless of mass (disproving Aristotle) and formulates the concept of **inertia**.
- **1687:** **Isaac Newton (The Great Synthesis)**
    - Publishes _Principia Mathematica_. He defines the **Three Laws of Motion** and the **Law of Universal Gravitation**. This work explains everything from the falling of an apple to the orbit of the moon. This is the birth of **Classical Mechanics**.

### **Era 6: The Industrial Age (Energy & Electromagnetism)**

_Physics is used to power machines and understand invisible forces._

- **1800:** **Alessandro Volta**
    - Invents the electric battery, allowing for the continuous flow of **electric current**.
- **1824:** **Sadi Carnot (Thermodynamics)**
    - Studies steam engines and defines the relationship between heat and work. This leads to the **Laws of Thermodynamics** (critical for the Industrial Revolution).
- **1865:** **James Clerk Maxwell**
    - Unifies electricity and magnetism into a single theory: **Electromagnetism**. He predicts that light is an electromagnetic wave.

### **Era 7: Modern Physics (The Reality Shift)**

_Physics discovers that the universe is much stranger than Newton thought._

- **1897:** **J.J. Thomson**
    - Discovers the **electron**, proving that atoms are not indivisible.
- **1905:** **Albert Einstein (Relativity)**
    - Publishes **Special Relativity** (E=mc2), showing that mass and energy are interchangeable and that time is relative to speed.
- **1915:** **Einstein's General Relativity**
    - Redefines gravity not as a force, but as the **curvature of space-time**.
- **1920s:** **Quantum Mechanics (Bohr, Heisenberg, Schrödinger)**
    - Physicists discover that at the subatomic level, particles act like waves and probability governs reality. This leads to the uncertainty principle.
- **1945:** **The Atomic Age**
    - The first detonation of a nuclear weapon demonstrates the massive energy release predicted by nuclear physics.
- **1960s-Present:** **The Standard Model & Cosmology**
    - Discovery of quarks, black holes, and the Big Bang theory. Physics now spans from the smallest particles (Higgs Boson, 2012) to the expansion of the entire universe.
