Based on a rigorous 10-step visual analysis of the brush texture, composition, line quality, and color palette, here is the precise prompt to replicate this specific "indie sketchbook" anime style.

  

Style Analysis Breakdown

Line Art: The defining feature is rough, loose, and sketchy line work. The lines are not polished or stabilized; they mimic a fast gesture drawing using a textured digital ink pen.

Coloring & Texture: The coloring is flat but uses opaque, painterly brush strokes rather than gradients. The white sea foam is painted with thick, blobby shapes (gouache style) without outlines.

Composition: The image uses a wide-angle lens effect (close-up foreground, distant background) to create depth. The girl is in extreme foreground (right), while the boy is smaller in the mid-ground (left).

Character Design: Simplistic, expressive facial features. The eyes are large and reflective with simple highlights. The blush on the cheeks is applied with a rough "scribble" texture.

Palette: High contrast. Deep ocean teals and cyans contrasted against stark white clothing and black hair/pants.

  
    indie anime art style, rough digital sketchbook aesthetic. Subject: A candid summer beach scene. Foreground: A close-up of a girl with a black bob haircut and blunt bangs, looking back at the viewer with a surprised, open-mouthed expression. She has large brown eyes and scribbled textured blush on her cheeks. Background: A boy with white messy hair, wearing a loose white shirt and rolled-up black pants, standing ankle-deep in the water looking away. Environment: Deep teal ocean water with thick, painterly, blobby white foam and waves crashing on the shore. The sky is bright blue with rough, painterly clouds. Technique: Loose jittery black outlines, flat coloring with hard-edged shadows, expressive brushwork, lack of smoothing, energetic and breezy atmosphere, wide-angle composition.
