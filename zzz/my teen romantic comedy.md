why does this sound like the prelude
 If you have an excuse, I’ll hear it now.

It’s your fault for being vague.
Don’t argue over small details.
Wrongdoing must be punished after all.
don’t worry about that. I’m not going to ask you to do physical labor.

I won’t accept any arguments, disagreements, objections, questions, or back talk.
Cool your head for a bit and think about what you did.
 I think you should just knock some discipline into him.
 brimming with ulterior motives.

None of that was complimentary in the slightest.
You were showing me the answer all along.

I give in. I have no idea.
I’m not shabby.
you weirdo. I’m creeped out already.
Shut up! I don’t want to hear that from you!

 I couldn’t say that. The truth can be too painful to hear sometimes after all…
 Don’t avert your eyes from the truth.
 for some reason, it kind of makes sense…

It’s about time for you to apologize

Don't sneak up on me like that.
I might end up getting a bit too rough with you by mistake.
That's way too cryptic.
I never asked for any of this.

That's just wordplay. Don't try to change the subject.
Are you ignorant.

Please stop acting like a child. It's honestly embarrassing to watch someone your age get this excited.

You don't get a say in this.
This is pure dictatorship...

That's total profiling

Fine. I hate falling for such a blatant provocation, but I'll accept.
I'll be the judge. My rulings will be completely biased and unfair, obviously.
just give it your best shot
