SUBJECT: 

ART STYLE - SURGICAL REFINEMENTS:1. Shading (CRITICAL): "Hard-Cut Cel Shading." The shadows on the white shirt must be PALE BLUE-GREY and GEOMETRIC. Use sharp, jagged, angular shapes for shadows (triangles and polygons), NOT curved or soft blobs. Strictly NO gradients.2. Line Art: Ultra-thin, constant-width lines. The lines should feel like a fine-point pen, not a thick marker.3. Facial Features: Minimalist "Eguchi" nose (tiny line), realistic mouth placement, small pupils. The expression must be completely emotionless.4. Background: The sky is a flat, solid deep cyan. The trees at the bottom must look like a "Hand-painted Gouache Background Layer." They should look like a flat painting with visible brush strokes, NOT detailed 3D trees. 

COMPOSITION: Flat, 2D, retro-pop aesthetic. High contrast sunlight.
