 he was a hard-nosed arms dealer who knew exactly what he was doing.


The whole reason we have the Nobel Prize is basically the ultimate PR stunt in history. In 1888, his brother Ludvig died, but a French newspaper messed up and thought Alfred was the one who kicked the bucket. They ran a headline that read, "The Merchant of Death is Dead," and described him as a man who got rich by finding new ways to mutilate and kill people. Alfred read that over his morning coffee and realized that if he didn't change the narrative fast, that was going to be his legacy forever.

It wasn’t just dynamite, either. While we talk about dynamite being for "mining," he eventually bought Bofors, a massive ironworks, and turned it into a full-scale armament factory. He spent his final years neck-deep in the weapons industry, developing smokeless gunpowder and better cannons. He was basically the Tony Stark of the 19th century

The Peace Prize was basically his "get out of hell free" card. He left 94% of his massive fortune to fund these awards specifically to overwrite the "Merchant of Death" label. It worked so well that most people today don't even realize the money for the Peace Prize comes from a guy who owned nearly 100 explosives and munitions factories.

the guy was a master strategist, even from the grave. This wasn't just a random act of kindness; it was a cold, calculated move to make sure his name survived as long as humans are around.

But Nobel didn’t come up with the "peace" part entirely on his own. He had a massive push from a woman named Bertha von Suttner.

Bertha was actually Nobel’s secretary for a very short time, but they became lifelong pen pals. She was a hardcore peace activist and wrote a famous anti-war book called _Lay Down Your Arms_. She spent years essentially guilt-tripping him in their letters, telling him he needed to use his genius and his money to do something for the world instead of just blowing it up. He once wrote back to her saying, "Inform me, convince me, and then I shall do something great for the movement." She basically became the conscience he didn't have.

When it came to the actual structure—the "Trust" idea—that was Alfred’s brand of genius. He realized that if he just donated the money to a government or a charity, it would eventually get swallowed up or forgotten. By creating a perpetual fund where only the _interest_ is given away as prizes, he ensured the money would never run out.

The way he set it up was actually a mess at first. He wrote his final will on a single piece of paper at a Swedish club in Paris, without even using a lawyer. He was so paranoid about people trying to steal his money that he didn't tell his family or even the organizations he picked to give out the awards. When he died, the Swedish Academy and the others were like, "Wait, we have to do what?"

His family actually tried to sue to stop the will because they wanted the cash. It only went through because his young assistant, Ragnar Sohlman, literally spent years fighting the family and traveling across Europe with bags of Nobel’s cash and gold to hide it from the lawyers.

So while Nobel had the money and the ego to want to be remembered, Bertha von Suttner was the one who pointed his legacy toward "peace" instead of just "explosives." Without her, there’s a good chance he’d just be remembered as the guy who made war more efficient.

The crazy thing is, Bertha ended up winning the Peace Prize herself a few years after he died. She’s the reason the "Merchant of Death" got a second life as a hero.

# How rich is he ??

If you look at raw numbers, Elon Musk is way wealthier. But if you look at "Power" and how much of the world's money they actually controlled, Nobel was a monster.

When Nobel died in 1896, he left about 31 million Swedish Kronor.1 If you just adjust that for standard inflation, it's roughly **$200 million** today. That sounds like a "basic" rich guy in 2024, not a world-shaper. But that’s the wrong way to look at it.

Here is the real breakdown of how they compare:

### The "Share of the Pie"

The best way to compare them is by looking at their wealth as a percentage of the total economy. In 1896, the world was much "poorer" in terms of total cash. Nobel’s fortune was so massive that he was essentially a one-man investment bank for the entire planet.

Musk’s net worth (around $250–$300 billion) is astronomical, but it's mostly "paper wealth" tied to Tesla stock. Nobel’s wealth was largely liquid—gold, cash, and ownership of nearly 100 factories and mines across the globe. If Musk tried to sell all his Tesla stock tomorrow, the price would crater. Nobel actually had the "dry powder" to move world markets instantly.

### The "Patented Power"

Nobel held 355 patents.2 He didn't just run a company; he owned the _science_ that built the modern world. Every time a tunnel was dug, a mountain was cleared for a railroad, or a shell was fired in a war, Nobel got a cut. Musk has a similar vibe with SpaceX and Starlink, but Nobel’s tech was the literal "operating system" of the industrial revolution.

### The Longevity Test

This is where Nobel wins. Musk’s wealth is tied to the current tech bubble. If EVs or rockets become a commodity, his net worth could drop 80% in a year.

Nobel’s wealth, however, was so well-structured that it has survived:

- Two World Wars
- The Great Depression
- The collapse of the Russian Empire (where he had massive oil holdings)
- The invention of the internet
    

His trust has been paying out millions of dollars every single year for over 120 years and _it’s still growing_. The fund is currently worth over $600 million. Nobel didn't just build a fortune; he built a self-sustaining financial machine that literally cannot die as long as the global economy exists.

So, while Musk is "richer" on a computer screen today, Nobel’s wealth was more "solid." He was the kind of rich where you don't just buy a social media platform; you buy the materials used to build the entire physical world.

By the way, did you know Nobel’s oil company in Russia (Branobel) was actually the first real rival to Rockefeller’s Standard Oil? He was basically an oil tycoon, an arms dealer, and a tech disruptor all rolled into one.

### Why the Nobel Prize Survived

The reason the Nobel Prizes didn't disappear during this chaos is that Alfred Nobel was a skeptic. He never trusted one single country with his money. When he died in 1896, his assistant **Ragnar Sohlman** had to literally smuggle Alfred's cash and stocks out of France in a horse-drawn carriage to avoid taxes and legal freezes.

Because the majority of the Prize money was invested in "safe" international securities (bonds and stocks in Sweden, London, and Paris), it was untouchable.
