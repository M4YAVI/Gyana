alright. look. pierre by melville. it's basically this guy's life getting progressively worse until everyone dies. here's what happens.

**start:**

pierre glendinning is some rich kid in upstate new york. his dad's dead. his mom's controlling but he's cool with it. he's got this beautiful fiancée, lucy tartan. life's... fine. boring actually. he's young, good-looking, has money. that's the whole setup.

**the problem shows up:**

so this woman isabelle or isabella appears. dark, mysterious, says she's his half-sister. illegitimate. their father's secret kid. she's got a portrait of his dad and everything. pierre recognizes it immediately.

here's where it gets weird. he believes her. like, he just... accepts this. and now he's got this problem nobody knows about. his mom doesn't know. lucy doesn't know. nobody.

**the stupid decision:**

instead of like... telling people or getting proof or anything normal, pierre decides he has to help isabella. he's gonna abandon his fiancée, abandon his comfortable life, and basically become responsible for this woman nobody else knows about.

he tells his mom he's leaving. she loses it. disowns him basically.

**new york city arc:**

pierre takes isabella to the city. tells everyone he married her to cover for her reputation. total lie. but now everyone thinks he's married to this woman when really she's supposedly his sister.

lucy finds out he's gone. she's devastated. she follows him to the city. now she's in the city too, heartbroken, watching him with isabella.

**everything falls apart:**

pierre tries to be a writer to support them all. doesn't work. he's got no money coming in. his mom won't help him. society won't help him. he's isolated, broke, living in this cramped apartment.

lucy gets sick from the stress and heartbreak. isabella's needy and dependent. pierre's losing his mind trying to hold this together. he's writing badly, not making money, watching lucy die slowly.

**the ending:**

pierre goes to prison for like... i don't even remember the exact charge. something about killing someone or a duel or whatever. doesn't matter. while he's in prison, lucy dies. isabella kills herself. pierre kills himself in prison.

everyone's dead. it's bleak as hell.

**what's actually happening:**

the whole book is melville saying that life doesn't care about your good intentions. pierre thought he was doing the right thing helping isabella. but he was actually just selfish and naive. he destroyed lucy out of his own moral confusion. he built his entire life on a lie.

and the kicker is he never even figured out if isabella was actually his sister. he just... believed it and ruined his life on faith in some random woman's story.

**the whole vibe:**

pierre keeps writing and thinking he's this genius. he's not. he's just a guy who made one dumb decision and spent the rest of the book making worse ones trying to fix it.

melville's basically saying: don't be like pierre. don't think you're smarter than you are. don't make huge life decisions based on incomplete information. and definitely don't convince yourself you're helping people when you're really just being self-righteous.

it's depressing. it goes nowhere. nobody learns anything. they all just die.

that's the book.
